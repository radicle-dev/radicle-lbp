OVERVIEW

The steps for the sale:

0. Radicle governance system is deployed.
1. DEPLOYER deploys `RadicleLbp` contract, which deploys `Sale` contract.
2. PROPOSER gathers 1M RAD in delegated votes.
3. PROPOSER proposes the radicle sale, which calls `Sale::begin`.
4. Voting begins.
5. After voting ends, PROPOSER queues the proposal.
6. FOUNDATION transfers USDC balance to the `Timelock` contract, during timelock delay period.
7. Timelock delay (2 days) period elapses.
8. PROPOSER or someone else executes proposal.
9. LBP is now created. Buying and selling starts. Pool shares (RADP) are minted for the Timelock.
