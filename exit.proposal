# Exit LBP & add Uniswap liquidity

This is a proposal to complete the LBP event by exiting the pool. To maintain
a liquid market, 4M USDC and 400K RAD are added to a Uniswap trading pair.

If executed, this proposal will:

1. Remove liquidity from the LBP, by swapping the RADP pool tokens for the underlying assets (RAD and USDC)
2. Return the 3.5M USDC loan to the Radicle Foundation
3. Approve Uniswap router proxy for 5M USDC
4. Approve Uniswap router proxy for 500K RAD
5. Add liquidity to Uniswap RAD/USDC pair via the Uniswap router

After execution, the Timelock holds all Uniswap LP tokens for the RAD/USDC pair.

To prevent front-running, the RAD/USDC balances are set through the Uniswap
router *proxy* contract, deployed at `0xB76FC4EbE4fC0CC34AF440Ad79565A68Bfcb095e`.
Only the Radicle Foundation can set these balances, via the `setLiquidity`
function. This contract function must be called as close as possible to the
execution of this proposal, to provide liquidity at the correct market price.

## Notes
